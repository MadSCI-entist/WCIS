WCIS – DIY Irrigation System Using ESP32

WCIS (Wirelessly Controlled Irrigation System) is an ESP32-based smart irrigation controller designed to control a solenoid valve for turning water flow ON and OFF automatically or manually.

WCIS uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control a DC solenoid valve through a MOSFET driver circuit.

The system can be expanded to include:

Scheduled irrigation (using NTP time)
Web-based control dashboard
Manual override
